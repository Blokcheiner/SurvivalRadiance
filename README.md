# SurvivalRadiance
When we all pool our dollars together, we create something greater than just a directory. We create a community of people who value their safety and are willing to share this knowledge with each other. It is the collective effort that makes the project powerful, and every dollar invested becomes a brick in the foundation of our collective security.
